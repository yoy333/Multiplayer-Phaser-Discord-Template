# Description
This Project is a template for those interested in making a multiplayer game with phaser + socket.io that can be used as a discord activity - while using typescript and vite.

It follows these tutorials:
![setting up multiplayer w/ socket and phaser](https://gamedevacademy.org/creating-a-simple-multiplayer-game-in-phaser-3-with-an-authoritative-server-part-1/)
![exporting to a discord activity](https://phaser.io/tutorials/creating-discord-games-with-phaser)

As a note, you still have to follow the steps of the former tutorial in regards to setting up the game on the discord developer portal. And adding the .env file to the root directory of this template.
